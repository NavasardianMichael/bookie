/**
 * Origin check on every state-changing request.
 *
 * **Why the session cookie's `sameSite: 'lax'` is not enough.** `lax` withholds the cookie
 * on cross-*site* requests except top-level GET navigations, which does cover a plain
 * `<form method="post">` on someone else's page. But "site" is the registrable domain, not
 * the origin, and that leaves two gaps:
 *
 * - In production the web app and this API are different subdomains of one domain, so
 *   *every* sibling subdomain is same-site and unrestricted — including a forgotten
 *   marketing host, a staging box, or one lost to a subdomain takeover. An XSS anywhere on
 *   the domain becomes full CSRF against this API.
 * - In development `:4141` and `:4142` differ only by port, which is not part of the site
 *   either — so `lax` restricts **nothing** locally, and a CSRF regression cannot be
 *   reproduced before it ships. That alone justifies an explicit control.
 *
 * **Why an Origin check rather than a token.** A synchroniser token has nowhere to live:
 * the session is a stateless JWT (`lib/session.ts`) with no server-side record to bank a
 * per-session token in, which is the premise of that design. That leaves double-submit —
 * and double-submit is defeated by exactly the attacker `lax` misses, because a sibling
 * subdomain can set cookies on the parent domain and therefore forge both halves of the
 * pair. `Origin` is set by the browser and cannot be written from script, which is the
 * property actually required here.
